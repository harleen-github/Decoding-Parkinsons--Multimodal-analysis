Overview
This project focuses on detecting Parkinson's disease using voice recordings and handwriting data. It involves training machine learning models to analyze the characteristics of voice and handwriting patterns that may indicate the presence of Parkinson's disease. The project uses the Oxford Parkinson's Disease Voice Dataset and two handwriting datasets: Spiral_HandPD and Meander_HandPD.

Key Features:
->Voice data analysis using Random Forest and MLP classifiers.
->Handwriting data analysis using Random Forest and MLP classifiers.
->Cross-validation for model evaluation.
->Web app for interactive project visualization and analysis.
->Data visualizations (heatmaps, histograms, etc.) for data exploration.
->SMOTE for handling class imbalance in the dataset
